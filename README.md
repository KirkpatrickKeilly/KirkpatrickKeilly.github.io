  I am a journalism major at Lehigh University. I graduated from the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania in 2019 and I am graduating from Lehigh University in May of 2024. I am a reporter for Lehigh's school newspaper, the Brown and White. Beyond writing, I am passionate for design, videography, and photography. I am currently an intern in the Marketing Communications office.

  My favorite hobbies include going on walks while listening to music and spending time with my friends. I enjoy social media, and learning about the logistics behind how certain platforms work. Further than that, I love watching true crime and beauty videos. Something that is special about me is that I grew up on a miniature horse farm with horses, sheep, goats, dogs, a cat, and a guinea pig.

Americans’ Social Media Use by Jeffrey Gottfried
<br>
Data was taken from a Pew Research Center survey of 5,733 U.S. adults, conducted from May 19 - Sept. 5, 2023. The findings show that YouTube is the most widely used online platform measured in the survey (83% of those surveyed reported using it). YouTube was followed by FaceBook (68% of those surveyed) and Instagram (47%).

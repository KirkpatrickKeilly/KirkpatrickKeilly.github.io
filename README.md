  I am a journalism major at Lehigh University. I graduated from the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania in 2019 amd I am graduating from Lehigh University in May of 2024. I am a reporter for Lehigh's school newspaper, the Brown and White. Beyond writing, I am passionate for design, videography, and photography. I am currently an intern in the Marketing Communications office.

  My favorite hobbies include going on walks while listening to music and spending time with my friends. I enjoy social media, and learning about the logistics behind how certain platforms work. Further than that, I love watching true crime and beauty videos. Something that is special about me is that I grew up on a miniature horse farm with horses, sheep, goats, dogs, a cat, and a guinea pig.
